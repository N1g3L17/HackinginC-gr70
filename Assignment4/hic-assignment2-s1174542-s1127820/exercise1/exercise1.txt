## Used input to invoce a shell.
./buffer $(spamf "AA" 51; spamf "/bin/sh" 1)

## Explaination
Actually, I found the solution to this assignment quite quickly. 
When I looked at the code, I saw that ‘buffer’ was an array of 100 characters and 
that it was located on the stack together with ‘command’. The goal of this assignment 
is to overwrite the contents of ‘command’, which is located on the stack, via the ‘buffer’ 
array and cause it to overflow. First, I tried to overflow the buffer with lots of A's until 
I saw the A's in the command piece. Then I specified ‘/bin/sh’ as the end buffer and adjusted 
the number of A's so that the ‘command’ array was completely overwritten with ‘/bin/sh’. 

Voila! An interactive shell.
